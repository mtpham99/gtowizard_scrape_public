# GTOWizard Pre-flop Ranges Webscraper

Webscraper written in python for obtaining pre-flop ranges from the [GTOWizard](https://app.gtowizard.com/solutions) webapp.

# READ ME
Note the code for the webscraper is currently not public, but a copy of the scraped ranges is available under "releases".
To obtain and use the currently provided ranges, download the ["GTOWizard_Scraped_Ranges.zip"](https://github.com/mtpham99/gtowizard_scrape_public/releases/download/v0.1-ranges-only/GTOWizard_Scraped_Ranges.zip) located [here](https://github.com/mtpham99/gtowizard_scrape_public/releases/tag/v0.1-ranges-only).

If you have [GTO+](https://gtoplus.com) or [Flopzilla](https://flopzilla.com), you can import the entire unzipped folder to either of these programs to have all the ranges available in the software.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me at [gtowizard-scraper-help@quantamail.net](mailto:gtowizard-scraper-help@quantamail.net)
