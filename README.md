# GTOWizard Ranges Webscraper

Webscraper written in python for obtaining ranges from the [GTOWizard](https://app.gtowizard.com/solutions) webapp.

# ***UPDATE***: Free Ranges Survey

I have recently finished rewriting the scraper to handle more game types/settings, and I am planning which ranges to scrape next. I am requesting anyone interested to email me at [gtowizard-scraper-help@quantamail.net](mailto:gtowizard-scraper-help@quantamail.net) with the subject heading "GTOWizard Scraper Survey" detailing which settings they would like scraped.

Please be very specific about which ranges you are requesting by providing a screenshot of the settings or specifying them like below.

Example settings:
- solutions: cash
- type: classic
- players: 6max
- available spots: postflop included
- stacks: 100
- bet sizes: general
- rake: NL50
- opening size: GTO
- 3bet size: GTO

NOTE: I do not have GTOWizard premium, so I cannot scrape the premium ranges. I also do not currently plan to provide post-flop ranges.

I will scrape the most commonly requested settings and provide them for free here when I am finished.

# READ ME

The scraped ranges or available for free, but the code for the webscraper is not public.
To obtain and use the currently provided ranges, download the ["GTOWizard_Scraped_Ranges.zip"](https://github.com/mtpham99/gtowizard_scrape_public/releases/download/v0.1-ranges-only/GTOWizard_Scraped_Ranges.zip) located [here](https://github.com/mtpham99/gtowizard_scrape_public/releases/tag/v0.1-ranges-only).

If you have [GTO+](https://gtoplus.com) or [Flopzilla](https://flopzilla.com), you can import the entire unzipped folder to either of these programs to have all the ranges available in the software.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me at [gtowizard-scraper-help@quantamail.net](mailto:gtowizard-scraper-help@quantamail.net)
